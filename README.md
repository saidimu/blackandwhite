## `black & white` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saidimu/blackandwhite.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/saidimu/blackandwhite)

In the wake of Facebook's news feed [controversy](http://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-to-know-about-facebooks-trending-controversy-1462915385), The Wall Street Journal created `Blue Feed, Red Feed`:

> To demonstrate how reality may differ for different Facebook users, The Wall Street Journal created two feeds, one “blue” and the other “red.” If a source appears in the red feed, a majority of the articles shared from the source were classified as “very conservatively aligned” in a large 2015 Facebook study. For the blue feed, a majority of each source’s articles aligned “very liberal.” These aren't intended to resemble actual individual news feeds. Instead, they are rare side-by-side looks at real conversations from different perspectives. http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/

[`black & white`](https://newscuria.firebaseapp.com/) is a similar effort but targetting Twitter instead of Facebook news feeds.
